As a computer vision Practitioner, I worked on a project to develop a semiconductor defect detection system. One of the key steps in this project was annotating around 500 images to build a custom dataset. Each image contained approximately 50 defects that needed to be labeled. This process could be quite tedious and time-consuming, and I was determined to find a more efficient solution.

After searching high and low for annotation software that would make my life easier, I stumbled upon Roboflow. And let me tell you, it was like a match made in computer vision heaven. Roboflow had this amazing feature that was the answer to my annotation prayers â€“ the ability to copy all annotations from one image and paste them onto the next image. It was like magic!

Roboflow's annotation software was a lifesaver. It saved me countless hours of tedious clicking and labeling, and it allowed me to focus on the more exciting parts of my project. If you're looking for a way to streamline your annotation workflow, I highly recommend giving Roboflow a try. It's the secret weapon that will make you the annotation master of the computer vision world.
Creating a custom model to detect your objects is an iterative process of collecting and organizing images, labeling your objects of interest, training a model, deploying it into the wild to make predictions, and then using that deployed model to collect examples of edge cases to repeat and improve.
